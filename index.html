			I named him myself! do you like it?<br>
			Bluggy and I are best friends and like to go on adventures together. Do you like going on adventures with your friends?<br>
			Yesterday Saturday, Septemter 14, 2019, me and Bluggy went to a birthday party together! There was a bouncy house with a slide and an obstacle course!<br>
			It was so much fun to bounce in! Here's the bad part, while we were bouncing...it started to rain!<br>
			Bluggy and I got wet, so we went inside. We had strawberry cupcakes and chocolate cake!<br>
			Then we played ball with Jean-Luc,one of the two birthday boys that the party was for!<br>
			The two birthday boys were: Simon and Jean-Luc.<br>
			And that is the first adventure of...Bluggy and me!
